File: aptus-upgrade.png is based on gnome-mime-application-x-java.png which is a part of Noir Crystal icon set.
Noir Crystal is an icon theme inspired by Cylon by Naf71 and black-white by DBG.
The majority of icons used in Noir Crystal are from the wonderful Crystal B & W Vista/XP theme by Pit-Tux http://pit-tux.deviantart.com/.
Folders are by Jérémy Paul http://shteuf.deviantart.com/.
Network and Browser icons by Lothar Grimme http://www.grafixport.org/ from his KDE icon theme Carpelinx.
The drive-harddisk icons are by Laurent Baumann http://lbaumann.com/.
Other resources I used were Dark Glass for KDE 3.x by Alessandro Rei http://www.mentalrey.it/icons.html, Human-O2 by Schollidesign http://schollidesign.deviantart.com/art/Human-O2-Iconset-105344123, and especially Oxygen-Refit by deviantdark http://deviantdark.deviantart.com/art/Oxygen-Refit-70199755.
Plus some nicked from MacOSX.
